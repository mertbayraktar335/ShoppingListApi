# Mert Bayraktar Project Shopping List Api

## Overview
In this project, I developed a Web API where users can save and track the products they plan to buy. Users can create and control category-based lists. Onion Architecture was designed with CQRS Pattern in the project. There are two types of roles in the project. First of all, it is possible to follow and update the lists belonging to the user in the user role. In the Admin role, all lists in the system can be viewed.
